This will not work with Firewalls/NAT's(on the server side)
load bnet.client/server, connect, 
press reinit link connection,
open basicboy ,click options->
emulated hardware->emulate link.
The emulator should link with the chat
(hehe this sounds a bit strange...).

Notes:
***The speed is Realy bad***
It may not work with slow connections/some
roms...It is olny tested with Pokemon Gold
