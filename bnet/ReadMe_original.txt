Title: Client-Server Example using VB's Winsock control
Description: This completely-commented project demonstrates the use of Winsock in a server-client connection. Demonstrates how to use the connection as a remote, similar to Sub7 (client sends commands to the server, server responds with API calls, etc.), as well as a private chat connection between the server and client. **Developers who are not familiar with VB's winsock control: This download is a must!
Note: This is my 8th project uploaded since Sunday morning :D
